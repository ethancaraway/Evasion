As players move their pieces across the board, abilities can be used to teleport pieces, chain together multiple moves at once, or even steal an opponent's piece for their own use, just to name a few. With hundreds of different ability combinations, Evasion allows every game to be an interesting and unique experience and requires players to both think on their feet as well as develop their own distinct styles and strategies.";

When a player selects a piece to move, any tiles that piece can move to will be highlighted blue.\nFirst, a piece can move to any adjacent, unoccupied tile. Once a piece has moved to an adjacent tile, the player's turn is over.\nSecond, if an adjacent tile is occupied by a piece and the next tile in that direction is unoccupied, a piece can jump the adjacent piece and land on the unoccupied tile (the same as in Checkers). After a jump, the piece is allowed to continue jumping pieces if an additional jump is available to the piece. A player's turn ends when the piece has no more jumps available or when the player chooses to stop moving.\nA piece is allowed to jump both the player's pieces and the opponent's pieces. If the player jumps an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the board. Tiles occupied by an opponent's piece that the player's selected piece can capture will be highlighted red to indicate a potential capture.";

Pieces can only be granted one ability per game, however, the player's white piece is not allowed to have any abilities. When a piece is granted an ability, only that piece is allowed to use the ability. If that piece is captured, the ability is disabled, and the player can no longer use the ability. If the ability affects the piece's movement, any tiles the piece can move to using the ability will be highlighted purple when the piece is selected to move.\nOther abilities are not assigned to a singular piece. These global abilities can be used on multiple pieces. These abilities must be used at the beginning of a turn before any pieces have moved. Some of these abilities can only be used once per game, and once they are used, the ability is disabled.\nBoth of the players' chosen abilities are always displayed on screen. A player can hover the mouse over the name of an ability at any time to view the ability's description. When an ability is disabled, the name of the ability will turn grey to indicate that the player can no longer use the ability. If an ability is assigned to a specific piece, the color of the piece will be displayed next to the name of the ability. If an ability is a global ability, a Use Button will be displayed next to the name of the ability. The player can click the Use Button to activate the ability on that turn. A grey Use Button indicates that the ability is not available to use at that time.";
